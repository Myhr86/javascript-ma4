1. It is short for Document Object Model. It is an object that is created when the page is loaded.
   It is sort of like a family tree, but instead of family members, it consists of Objects.
   The DOM is usally used in the client side with JavaScript and CSS.

2. createElement(), querySelector() and addEventListener()

3. A asynchrounous call does not wait for the API call to return. It continues
   execution in our program, and when the call returns from a server it executes a "callback" function.

4. The sources tab can be used for debugging JavaScript code.
   You can make breakpoints and test different parts of the code. You can also edit Javascript and CSS.
   You can also use it to explore and view your files.

5. A Promise is a proxy for a value that we might not know at the time it is created.
   It lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods,
   instead of returning the final value right away.
   A promise can be three different states: pending, fulfilled or rejected.

6. API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols and tools for building software applications.
   An API allows applications to communicate to each other.

7. A JavaScript event can be a e.g: A mouse click, A keyboard button being pushed or the DOM being loaded.
   One can make a function that listens for a specific event, and then executes a function.

8. The event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and it is then propagated to the parent elements and all the way up the other ancestors.
